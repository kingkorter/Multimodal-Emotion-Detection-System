# 🎭 Multimodal Emotion Detection System (Audio + Facial Expressions)

This project implements a **multimodal emotion detection system** that predicts human emotions by combining **speech audio** and **facial expressions** using deep learning models.

The system integrates **audio-based emotion recognition** and **visual-based emotion recognition** into a single unified model for improved performance.

---

## 📌 Supported Emotions

The model classifies emotions into the following categories:

- Happy (HAP)
- Sad (SAD)
- Angry (ANG)
- Fear (FEA)
- Disgust (DIS)
- Neutral (NEU)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

This project uses a **three-part architecture**:

### 1️⃣ Voice Emotion Model
- **Model:** Wav2Vec2 (`facebook/wav2vec2-base`)
- Extracts speech representations from raw audio
- Applies temporal mean pooling and a classification head

### 2️⃣ Face Emotion Model
- **Model:** ResNet-50
- Processes facial images extracted from video frames
- Fine-tuned for emotion classification

### 3️⃣ Fusion Model
- Combines outputs from both audio and face models
- Uses feature concatenation followed by a fully connected layer
- Produces the final emotion prediction

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **CREMA-D Dataset Dataset sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/cremad)**
- Audio and video samples were aligned using filename-based matching
- Facial frames were extracted from video clips
- Data was split into training and testing sets

## 🧪 Model Training

Training was performed using **PyTorch** on **GPU-enabled Kaggle notebooks**.

### Training Pipeline
- Dataset loading and preprocessing
- Audio–face data pairing
- Separate training of:
  - Voice emotion model
  - Face emotion model
- Evaluation on validation datasets
- Multimodal fusion model training

All training logic is contained in:

training/model_development.ipynb


---

## 📊 Evaluation

- Audio-only and face-only models were evaluated independently
- The combined multimodal model was evaluated using paired audio–face samples
- Multimodal fusion demonstrated improved performance compared to unimodal approaches
